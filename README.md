# Bankist
Mini-Vanilla-Javascript-project done during UDEMY course. To check features, you may try logging in with username "js" (pw: 1111) and "jd" (pw: 2222)

As a newbie into programming world, I found this little project very interesting at the time. The moment I write these words is quite some time after the development of "the bankist", but I still find it interesting, as it approached basic UI update based on "login" status.
